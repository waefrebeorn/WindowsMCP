# WuBu Text-to-Speech (TTS) Subsystem

# This __init__.py can be used to define the public API of the TTS package,
# or to perform any necessary initialization when the package is imported.

# Example: Expose the main TTS engine class
# from .tts_engine import TTSEngine
# from .wubu_voice import WuBuVoice # Example if we make a generic WuBu voice based on GLaDOS
# from .kokoro_voice import KokoroVoice

# Or, it can be left empty if submodules are imported directly.

# Placeholder: print a message when the tts package is imported (for debugging/demonstration)
# print("WuBu TTS subsystem initialized.")

# TODO: Determine which specific TTS models/engines will be supported and how they are configured.
#       - Coqui TTS (XTTSv2 for a GLaDOS-like voice, other models for Kokoro?)
#       - Piper TTS (Fast, local, good quality voices)
#       - Web APIs (ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, etc.) - requires API keys and internet

# Configuration for TTS should ideally come from the main WuBu config file.
# For example, specifying which TTS engine to use by default, voice selection, API keys.
