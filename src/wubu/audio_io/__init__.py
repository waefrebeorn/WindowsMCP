# WuBu Audio Input/Output Management

# This package could handle:
# - Selecting audio input/output devices.
# - Managing audio streams for ASR (input) and TTS (output) if not handled by those modules.
# - Playing sound effects or notifications for WuBu.
# - Volume control for WuBu's voice or system audio.

# For now, it's a placeholder.
# WuBu TTS playback is currently handled by the TTS engines (e.g., via sounddevice).
# WuBu ASR audio capture would be handled by SpeechListener (also via sounddevice or similar).

# A dedicated AudioIO module could centralize these if WuBu requires more complex audio routing
# or effects (e.g., voice modulation, if not part of TTS model).

# Example structure:
# from .player import WuBuAudioPlayer
# from .recorder import WuBuAudioRecorder
# from .device_manager import WuBuAudioDeviceManager

# print("WuBu Audio I/O package initialized (Placeholder).")

# TODO for WuBu Audio I/O:
#       - Determine if a centralized AudioIO manager is needed for WuBu.
#       - If so, define its responsibilities and implement classes for:
#         - Playback of arbitrary audio (files, streams).
#         - Recording audio (if ASR needs more direct control than SpeechListener provides).
#         - Listing and selecting audio devices (could use sounddevice.query_devices()).
#         - System/application volume control (e.g. using pycaw on Windows).
#         The existing `desktop_tools/voice_output.py` and `voice_input.py` might offer some
#         starting points or could be integrated/refactored here if a unified audio_io is built.
