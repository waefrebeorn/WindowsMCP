# WuBu Vision Subsystem

# This package would handle tasks related to visual input processing,
# such as:
# - Screen capture and analysis (synergy with existing desktop_tools/screen.py, ocr_service.py)
# - Object detection
# - Image understanding
# - Interfacing with camera hardware

# For now, it's a placeholder.
# print("WuBu Vision subsystem initialized (Placeholder).")

# TODO: Define specific vision capabilities and choose appropriate libraries/models.
#       - OpenCV for basic image processing, screen capture.
#       - Pre-trained models for object detection (YOLO, SSD).
#       - OCR capabilities (Tesseract, EasyOCR) - could integrate with existing ocr_service.py.
#       - Multi-modal models for image captioning or VQA (Visual Question Answering) - like Moondream.
#       Integrate with desktop_tools/moondream_interaction.py if applicable.
