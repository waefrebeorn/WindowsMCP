# WuBu User Interface (UI) Package

# This package will contain modules related to the WuBu UI,
# which could be a text-based console UI, a web UI, or a desktop GUI.

# For now, it might just re-export the main UI class or function.
# from .wubu_ui import WuBu_UI_Main # Example if wubu_ui.py has a main class

# print("WuBu UI package initialized.")

# TODO: Decide on the primary UI framework (e.g., Qt for Python, CustomTkinter, Streamlit, Textual TUI).
# The choice will dictate the structure and content of this package.
